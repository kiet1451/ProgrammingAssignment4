#Code book of Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project Week 4 
By Kiet Huynh for the Coursera/JHU assignment.

#Data Source

UCI data acquired to process and clean for the further analysis from the website
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
The source information is from readme.txt in UCI HAR Dataset downloaded folder

#Data Processing

1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5) Creates a second data set from the data set of step (d), independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

#Variable
1) Imported from UCI zipfile
UCIactivity<- 6 activites of exercises
UCIfeature <- feature variable names of for X_test and X_train
UCItestS   <- test set of 30 subject number 
UCItrainS  <- train set of 30 subject number
UCItestX   <- test set feature measurements
UCItrainX  <- train set feature measurements
UCItestY   <- test set of 6 activities
UCItrainY  <- train set of 6 activities

2) Combined data
Features: feature data for X_test and X_train
Activities: activity data for Y_test and Y_train
Subjects: subject data for test and train

3) Column names
getUCIfeature <- subset with mean and standard only column names
UCI_combine   <- set of combined data from Features, Activities, and Subjects
select_name   <- column names of getUCIfeature, Subject, and Activity.
select_data   <- reduced data set of UCI_combine with selected column from select_name

4) Tidy data set
selected_data2 <-data set of the mean from Subject and Activity.
